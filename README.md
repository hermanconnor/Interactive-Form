# Interactive-Form
Techdegree-Project-3
In this project, JavaScript is used to enhance the interactivity of the fictional 'Full Stack Conference' form.
User input is validated using JavaScript, with helpful error messages being displayed when a user enters invalid information.
Extra:
JavaScript is used to disable/enable checkboxes, to prevent users from registering for activities with conflicting times.
The name, email, credit card, zip code, and cvv are validated in real-time and provide error messages.
The name and email fields display conditional error messages. If both are left blank, the error message displays that the field cannot be left blank. In the email, if the field is not formatted correctly, that error message is displayed. In the name field, if a number is entered the error message displays that the field can't contain numbers.
